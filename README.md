# SQL Functions and Scripts Repository

Welcome to my SQL Functions and Scripts Repository. This repository is a showcase of my SQL abilities, including functions, views, stored procedures, and more. It's designed to provide a clear overview of the SQL solutions I've developed.

## Introduction

In this repository, you'll find a collection of SQL functions, views, stored procedures, and table designs that demonstrate my SQL development skills. Each section is organized to help you quickly find the specific SQL assets you're interested in. Most of the projects created within this repository were created/altered using Azure SQL Database & the sample data provided from LTSales database from Microsoft.
